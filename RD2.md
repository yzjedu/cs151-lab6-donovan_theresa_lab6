and addressing the following questions:

Objective:
1. What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
   1. Designing and programming functions 
   2. Re-using many of the other aspects of Python we've learned so far 
   3. Testing code 
   4. Using loops for input validation and error checking


Procedure:
1. What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
   1.  First, we understood the problem 
   2. Next, we wrote an algorithm, talked about it to check if it would work, and asked for approval 
   3. Next, we created tests cases 
   4. Then we wrote our code and comments 
2. What were the Key concepts explored?
   1. Some of the key concepts explored were refactoring, functions, 
   localized and global variables and debugging

Results:
1. Did your results match what you expected to get?
   1. Yes our results are exactly what we wanted and expected 
2. Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
   1. We used test cases given to us

Reflection:
1. What challenges did you encounter?
   1.  One challenge that we encountered would be splitting up work and coding.
2. How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
   1. I understood the problem 
   2. Made a plan 
   3. I implemented my plan and tested it
3. Did you overcome them, and how? 
   1. Yes it took some time but all of my issues were handled
4. Any key takeaways? 
   1. A key takeaway for me would be refactoring, functions, 
   localized and global variables and debugging
5. Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
   1. Yes, I believe I learned everything I was intended to learn.
6. What was it like working with your partner? 
   1. It was great working with Theresa.

In lab 6 we were trying to learn and accomplish simplifying code by using functions.
We were also trying to make the code have better human computer interaction so it is more
visually appealing to the user. To solve this problem we created two different functions to call in the main function to 
create an organized program. Then at the very end we called the main function so the code can
operate. We took the already written code and algorithm and translated it to be in functions so that
we did not have to copy and paste the same lines of code for each option of the ATM. 
The key concepts explored were while loops inside of while loops, when to make and call functions, error checking, and 
testing the code several times. Yes, my results match what I expected to get although it took a few times to achieve.
We tried several test cases along with extreme cases to double check and make sure the code worked no matter what the 
conditions are. Some of the challenges we encountered were where to define the variables 'balance' and 'choicezee'.
We followed the first three rules of programming by planning out how we would tackle our task, making our algorithm a 
human readable essay, and then practicing and testing our code several times to make sure there were no niche errors.
We overcame our challenges by asking Dr. Zee for help and testing our code with several trial and error cases to 
successfully finish our program. Some key takeaways I have from Lab 6 are being able to write and call a function and 
really understand how functions and while loops work. I also learned that you can define a string with just a space. 
I think I did learn what I was supposed to from this lab because I am now able to write and call functions and how to 
define variables within them. It was great working with Donovan, we both contributed and communicated effectively to finish the lab.
